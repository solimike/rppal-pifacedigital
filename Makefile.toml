# Makefile for cargo-make
#
# In general, cargo-make has reasonable default tasks for this project. The tasks 
# defined in this makefile are generally a catalogue of tasks that are known to work 
# plus some tweaks where necessary. The absence of a target here doesn't necessarily
# mean it won't work and be appropriate.

[env]
TARGET = "arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf"      # First generation Raspberry Pi.

# Note that the default "build" task enables all features so will use the "mockspi"
# feature. This is probably what you want unless you're actually compiling natively on
# Raspberry Pi hardware. If that's what you really want, uncomment the args override.

# There is a potential problem with the RaspberryPi targets not being consistent because
# of an interaction between build scripts (build.rs) and the cross-compilation 
# environment.  Currently (as of cross v0.2.4) the cross compilation environment is
# a rather old Ubuntu 16.04 container. If a local build (on the PC host) is run before 
# making one of these RaspberryPi targets, the cross build will find an existing
# build script in the target directory left over from the local build.  In theory that's
# probably OK because the build script isn't expected to run on the target machine just
# in the cross-compilation container, which is still an x86 Linux.  However, the build
# script may depend on a glibc version too far ahead of the version in the container to
# be compatible and therefore fail to run.  
#
# Two workarounds have some merit]
#   1) Build the RaspberryPi targets before the local host targets because the build 
#      script compiled in the cross-compilation container will work with the more 
#      recent glibc on the host machine.
#   2) Force a clean before running the RaspberryPi targets to remove the incompatible
#      build script.
#
# This looks like being a short-term problem because the next version of cross should
# bump the base version of Ubuntu to 20.04.
